\begin{abstract}
  
Machine learning and data mining have been used everyday in all
industries driven by data.H2O is a platform using for performing
machine learning and predictive analytics for large scale date using
cloud. When the data that is generated is large scale and is in
terrabytes, H2O serves a very important purpose of being able to
accurately predict using different algorithms using different
programming languages through APIs. This paper introduces to H2O, how
it has impacted various industries across several domains with
improved accuracy and reduced processing time. Different use cases of
the H2O platform has been explained as well.

\section{Introduction}

\cite{H2Odocumentation}H2O is an open source platform that is used
to create machine learning and predictive analytics models on big
datasets. It is mainly written in Javascript but have APIs for R ,
Python, Excel , Tableau and Flow and works on the conventional
operation systems. This platform allows the online scoring and
modelling of data on a single algorithm. The main algorithms
implemented on the datasets are deep learning , gradient boosting ,
generalized linear models , distributed random forest , k-means
etc. \cite{H2Odocumentation}The algorithms implemented on the big
datasets is read in a parallel manner and is then distributed and
stored in memory in a compressed column format. H2O also has an
inbuilt intelligence to detect and support the data ingest from
various sources in different formats.\

\section{How does H2O work?}

\cite{www-h2oyoutubevideo}H2O is mainly used for large dataset ,
usually in the range of terrabytes. A company might have their dataset
stored on big data systems such as hadoop. When we analyze a data
usually we choose a smaller sample dataset rather than the entire
dataset to build model due to the large processing time involved. H2O
has the advantage of being able to use the entire dataset to run the
algorithm on as larger the dataset we are able to analyse better the
predictions would be.  Suppose a business is trying to understand the
best product placement for optimal customer enagement, the model would
be created based on the dataset formed collecting information about
the interactions of the customer on the website. H20 is used to model
all of the data with multiple algorithms using more than one machine
at the same time, this way we don’t have to sample the data to predict
for performance. H2O is also used to score hundreds of models in nano
seconds to reach better predictions.

\section{Architecture}
\cite{www-h2o-architecture}
The H2O architecture consists of a different component which combine
together to form the H2O software stack. We can divide the H2O
architecture into 3 different components , top section includes all
the REST API clients , middle includes the Network Cloud and the
bottom section contains the different components that run within an
H20 JVM process.  The top section contains the programming languages
that can be used on the big dataset here . The REST API clients
communicate with the H2O with the help of a socket connection. The
Network cloud consists of the different inbuilt algorithms to create
the necessary model on the data , this can also contain a customized
customer algorithm to analyze the required dataset and produce the
desired outputs.  The H2O cloud can consists of two or more nodes
which can contain a single JVM process. Each JVM process consists of
language , algorithm and infrastructure (manages the resources
management such as memory and CPU).

\section {Used Cases}

\subsection { CapitalOne}
\cite{www-h2o-capitalone}
CapitalOne , a fortune 500 bank with 960 banks and 2000 ATMs
accumulates terrabytes of information in real time on customer
information and financial processing. H2O was used to reduce the
iterative timing over the large data sets on applying various
algorithms. Different algorithms can be applied to find which one
works best due to reduction in time consumed in processing these large
datasets. A large number of hard and soft metrics were evaluated as
well using machine learning frameworks.

\subsection {MarketShare}
\cite{www-h2o-marketshare}
The company MarketShare have implemented H2O to optimize budgeting for
marketing. Since marketing approaches are data driven features ,
predictive analytics under H2O was used to give a comparison on how
the current state of the marketing budget is and how much is the
predicted revenue, using H2O solutions were generated as to what are
the changes that can be made to improve the current projection and
what an improved projection will look like.  H2O can ingest large
amount of data as its capability is not limited to using one machine ,
since it is a cloud based system, multiple machines can be used at the
same time.  MarketShare was able to go on the cloud and use as much
machines as required and get desired outputs on the large
datasets.They use 25 machines for all of their clients to process the
data and were able to expand the scalability of the dataset.If their
datasize increases by x amount then they would add y more machines to
solve the problem. Scaling across lot of nodes is critical to their
business as the company deals with digital log data and irrespective
of the complexity of the modelling and the huge size of the data. It
has a distributed in- memory processing with the kind of data involved
and the algorithms implemented on the data.

\section {Resources to learn H2O from}

H2O has an open source platform and hence has a community for support.\newline
 Step by step instructions with documentation and videos have
been provided for installation and to understand the work flow of H2O.\newline
 Free online training videos are provided at
“http://learn.h2o.ai”\newline
H2O documentation is available on their website.
“https://h20.ai”\newline
h2ostream is an open source google group where H2O users can
post questions and get answers.\newline
They have built an online community at
“https://community.h2o.ai/index.html” which is a discussion platform.\newline
They also conduct conferences around the year in United
States for users to interact among one another and update new releases
and happenings in the big data community.

\section{Why H2O}
\cite{www-h2o-why}Being an open source platform it gives
user the flexibility to solve the problems. It is easy to set up and
has a smooth installation and usage feature due to its interface with
familiar programming environments using APIs. Models can also be
inspected during training.It can ingest any format of file , it can
even connect to data from HDFS, S3 ,SQL and NoSQL data sources.It has
a massive scalability, large datasets can be analyzed by using
multiple machines. It also conducts a real time data scoring for
accurate predictions.
