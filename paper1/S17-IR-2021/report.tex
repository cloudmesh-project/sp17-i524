\begin{abstract}
  Docker is a container based technology which helps in the packaging
  and shipping of applications quickly and across networks. Docker is
  being well accepted and appreciated in the Agile Software
  Development workforce and among the DEvOPs because of their
  attributes of Continous Integeration and testing.To create a cluster
  of Docker Engines into a single docker virtual engine is used
  Docker-Swarm sed which is tested for more than 50,000
  containers.

\maketitle

\cite{www-docker-2}Docker is an open-source container based technology. It is an extension
of Linux Containers (LXC): which is a unique kind of lightweight,
application-centric virtualization that drastically reduces overhead
and makes it easier to deploy software on servers. A container allows
a developer to package up an application and all its part includig
it's code, stack it runs on, dependencies it is associated with,system
tools and everything the application requirs to run within an
isolated enviorment. This makes it easier for programmers and
developers to run more apps on the same server and it even makes it
easier to package and ship the apps very frequently.

\section{ How Docker differs from VMs}

The virtualisation of application can be obtained with Hyervisors or
Virtual Machine Manager(VMM) which makes it easy for applications to
the run in isolation with one another while sharing the same
underlying hardware articture. VM hypervisors, such as Hyper-V, KVM,
and Xen, all are "based on emulating virtual hardware" which means
they’re fat in terms of system requirements.Instead of virtualizing
hardware, containers rest on top of a single Linux instance.A full
virtualized system gets its own set of resources allocated to it, and
does a very minimal sharing of thoses resources. So, the developer
gets more isolation but each Instance of the VM aslo has many "Junk VM
files", which is not useful to the developers as it gets "heavy".Since
they only require to keep the virtal machine image and it can be kept
small.Thus, the smaller the image is the less we need to store and the
less you need to send around the network which makes them fairly
lightwight in comparison to the Virtal Machines. Thus, we can run even
use 1000s of containers on a same host OS.
\cite{www-stackoverflow-docker}A full virtualized system usually
takes time to start whereas the Docker contaier do take even less than
seconds to up start and running with a lower overhead than the VMs.
Containers are potentially much more efficient than VMs because
they’re able to share a single kernel and share application libraries.
This can lead to substantially smaller RAM footprints even when
compared to virtualisation systems that can make use of RAM
overcommitment.  Storage footprints can also be reduced where deployed
containers share underlying image layers. IBM’s Boden Russel has done




\section{Docker MACHINE}

\cite{www-docker-machine}Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install 
Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine 
commands. You can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac 
or Windows box, on your company network, in your data center, or on 
cloud providers like AWS or Digital Ocean. Docker Machine is the only 
way to run Docker Engine on Mac or Windows previous to Dockerv1.12 
and starting with the Dockerv1.12 we have Docker for Mac and Docker for 
Windows. Thus we can create a cluster of Docker hosts which is called
a Swarm using Docker Machine.

\section{Docker SWARM}
\cite{www-docker-swarm}Docker Swarm provides native clustering 
capabilites to turn a group of Docker engines into a single, vrtual 
Docker Engine. These help you scale up the applications as if these all 
are running on a single,huge computer. It does so by providing a 

hardware resources are all virtualized and thus any bugs or viruses
could not affetc the other VM in the virtualized enviorment.

3.Thekinds of tools and technologies required to manage the containers
are still lacking in the industry and thus only a few management tools
from companies like Google and Docker like Kubernetes and SWarm
respectively are present which is not a good situation for an
open-source products

\section{Ecosystem Support to Docker}
Ecosystem support for Docker is improving with every passing day as it
is gaing the popularity among the developers and the system operators.

1.Operating Systems suppport to Docker: Is compatible with virtually
any distribution with a 2.6.32 + kernel RedHat Docker collaboration to
work with across fedora and other(2.6.32)+

2.It is compatible with Private PaaS(Platform as a Service)
technolgies: OPen Shift, Solum(Rackspace and OPenstack).

3.Public PaaS technologies like Voxoz, Cocaine(Yandex),Biadu,etc.

4.Ecosystem Support for IaaS is present via Rackspace,Digital Ocean,
AWS(Amazon Web Services), AMI,etc.

5.Orchestration tools Support and Integeration with:
Chef,Puppt,Jerkins,Travis,Ansible..

6.In Open Stack Docker integeration into NOVA(compatibility with
Glance,Horizon)are aslo present

\section{Future with Docker}

Docker Inc has set a clear path on the development of core
capabilities (libcontainer), cross service management (libswarm) and
messaging between containers (libchan). Docker's key open source
project is libcontainers ,which is on it's way to becomiing the
default standard for Linux-based technology.  Libcontainers enables
the containers to work with the Linux namespace, control groups,
capabilities, AppArmor security profiles, network interfaces and
firewalling rules in a consistent and predictable way .
\cite{www-docker-1}Libcontainers is getting help from Google, RedHat,
and Parallels to build the program asthey will work with docker as
core maintainers of the code.  libconatiner which is written natively
in Google's Go, is also being ported into other languages. Microsoft
may be porting it to ASP.NET.  Parallels' libct, which includes
libcontainer's functionality, has native C/C++ and Python
bindings. Microsoft is even jumping on board by bringing Docker to
their Azure platform, a development that could potentially make
integration of Linux applications with Microsoft products easier than
ever before.



\section{Conclusion}

\cite{www-slides-1}With more than 1200 Docker Contributors , 10,000 Dockerized
Applications at index.docker.io 3 to 4 million Developers using
Docker, 300 Million Downloads, 32,0000 Docker related Projects and 70
percent of enterprise using DockerIt is not an exaggeration that with
Docker Ecosystem there is a greater potential for some advanced
deployment tools that combine containers, configuration management,
continuous integration, continuous delivery and service orchestration
in the days ahead.
