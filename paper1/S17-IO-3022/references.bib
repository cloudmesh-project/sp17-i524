  abstract     = {Netty is an asynchronous event-driven
                  network application framework for rapid development
                  of maintainable high performance protocol servers &
                  clients. Netty is more than a collection of
                  interfaces and classes; it also defines an
                  architectural model and a rich set of design
                  patterns. It is protocol agnostic, supports both
                  connection oriented protocols using TCP and
                  connection less protocols built using UDP. Netty
                  offers performance superior to standard Java NIO API
                  thanks to optimized resource management, pooling and
                  reuse and low memory copying},
