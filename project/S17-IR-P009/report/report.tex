\begin{abstract}
Cloudmesh client is a simple client to enable access to multiple cloud environments form a command shell and command line. The user's can manage their set of resources right from their workstation.Currently cloudmesh client supports managing Virtual Machines across multiple clouds. In this project we have added the capability to manage/provision docker and swarm containers to cloudmesh client through a simple and extensible command line interface.

\section{Introduction}
In the time of Big data and Micro-Services,it is common to have a set of services running on multiple clouds.Docker\cite{www-Docker} with the build and ship model made the micro-services architecture work better.Since there would multiple containers running across multiple remote clouds managing them can become tedious.In project we have added the capability to provision and manage docker\cite{www-Docker} and swarm\cite{www-Swarm} containers to cloudmesh client\cite{las14cloudmeshmultiple}.

Clouldmesh Client\cite{las14cloudmeshmultiple} capability is detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:cmvm},it aims at managing vm instances in multiple heterogeneous clouds remotely via a command line interface.

The cloudmesh docker application build  can be broadly divided into Docker and Swarm modules.\\

The Docker Module capabilities are detailed in
Figure~\ref{fig:cmsdocker}. This module would help user perform
various docker functions mentioned in Section 3

\section{Application Architecture}
The architecture of the application is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Arch}.The commands developed can be broadly classified as 'action commands','Inquiry commands'.\\
The action commands are which would create or alter an entity.The entity can be a host/container/node. we use the corresponding API call to get the latest values for the changed entity.Docker API module is developed for addressing the docker commands and Swarm API module is used for swarm commands.\\
The Inquiry commands have two flavours a list and refresh mode.The list commands fetch the data locally from the Database and the refresh command will refresh the current state of the corresponding entity from the hosts.

\subsection{MongoDB and Python-eve}

The cloudmesh docker application uses MongoDB\cite{www-MongoDB} for data storage.The access to the database is all through
restful services supported through Python-eve\cite{www-Pythoneve}.The following are the entities for which collections are defined 
in eve and mongoDB.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Host
\item Image
\item Container
\item Network
\item Service
\item Node
\end{enumerate}
A key benefit of using a NoSQL data base like mongoDB is that it allowed us to store the data in the the DB in the native form as returned by the Docker Api without the need for much marshaling of the data .The application uses the cloudmesh.rest repository for managing mongo and eve services.

\subsection{Cloudmesh Common}

The application makes extensive use of common functions and tightly integrated into common functions available in the cloudmesh common repository for display formatting , YAML config management and timers

\subsection{Ansible}

As part of the project we have built Ansible\cite{www-Ansible} scripts to automate installation of docker in remote hosts and also deployment of docker images in these remote docker hosts.Below is the list of Ansible scripts that are built and used in the project 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install Docker in remote hosts and enable them for remote API access
\item Install Docker images in docker hosts .As part of the script the local docker files are synced with remote hosts and the images are built .
\item Setup /etc/hosts for remote hosts.This script allows to setup host names and IP in remote hosts which allows the applications to be configured to access by the standard host names instead of the IP address of the machine.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use Case - Elasticsearch cluster }
 Elasticsearch\cite{www-ElasticSearch} is an open-source, broadly-distributable, readily-scalable, enterprise-grade search engine. Accessible through an extensive and elaborate API, Elasticsearch can power extremely fast searches that support your data discovery applications[2]

 Using Cloudmesh  client , Ansible and Cloudmesh Docker application we deployed  and provisioned a Elasticsearch cluster on remote  hosts in Chameleon cloud in docker and swarm mode .We benchmarked the cluster using esrally\cite{www-ElasticSearchRally}  have compared  the  results between the elastic search clusters in docker and swarm mode.
 
 
 \subsection{Elasticsearch Cluster Docker Mode}
  For provisioning the Elasticsearch cluster in docker hosts below are the steps done
\begin{enumerate}
\item Created 3 Virtual Machines using Cloud Mesh Client .2 of the Virtual Machines  are to be used for the docker Elasticsearch cluster and 1 Virtual machine is the Benchmark server for the Kibana and esrally docker images 
\item Using Ansible scripts Install docker in 3 Virtual Machines and enable the docker daemon for remote access.
\item Using Ansible scripts Install Images of Elasticsearch  on hosts for docker cluster and the Image of Esrally in the Benchmark server .
\item Using the Cloudmesh Docker application we start 4 containers 2 in each of the virtual machines .To enable clustering of Elasticsearch applications running in the docker containers we need set the below parameters in container creation
\begin{verbatim}
    network_mode=host 
    environment=
    ["http.host=0.0.0.0",
    "transport.host=0.0.0.0",
    "discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts=docker1,docker2"]
\end{verbatim}

The network mode set to host allows the Elasticsearch containers use the underlying Virtual Machines  network for networking and leveraging the Elasticsearch unicast discovery find and form a cluster along with the other Elasticsearch instances running in other
containers either on the same host or different hosts.

\end{enumerate}

 \subsection{Elasticsearch Cluster Swarm Mode}
  For provisioning the Elasticsearch cluster in docker hosts in swarm mode below are the steps done
\begin{enumerate}
\item Created 3 Virtual Machines using Cloud Mesh Client .2 of the Virtual Machines  are to be used for the docker Elasticsearch cluster and 1 Virtual machine is the Benchmark server for the Kibana and esrally docker images 
\item Using Ansible scripts Install docker in 3 Virtual Machines and enable the docker daemon for remote access.
\item Using Ansible scripts Install Images of Elasticsearch  on hosts for docker cluster and the Images of Kibana and Esrally in the Benchmark server .
\item Using the Cloudmesh Docker application we first create a swarm cluster with the two docker hosts.Then we create a service in the Swarm  Manager Node.Along with the creation of the service we pass parameters to specify the number of replicas ,the network to be used , the mode of replication and the service name.
\begin{verbatim}
    ServiceMode.mode="replicated" 
    ServiceMode.replicas=4 
    EndpointSpec.ports=["9200:9200"] 
    networks=["elastic_cluster"] 
    env=["SERVICE_NAME=elasticsearch"]
\end{verbatim}

Swarm mode containers cannot use the the underlying host network as in the docker mode to enable the communication between the swarm containers we created a "overlay" network in the swarm manager.This network is passed in the service creation.So every container that is created by the swarm mode Manager will run on  this network .In the swarm mode to enable elastic search unicast discovery on start of the elastic search cluster using the Servicename environmental variable we identify other containers available in the cluster and dynamical set the \begin{verbatim} discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts \end{verbatim} parameter to enable elastic search to find and form a cluster with other Elasticsearch applications in the swarm.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Benchmarking Cloudmesh Docker} 
We performed benchmarking of the cloudmesh docker application for docker and  swarm commands .The benchmark was performed both in remote mode (Cloudmesh docker client is run on a network outside the cloud data center) and local mode (Cloudmesh docker client is run from a VM  inside the cloud data center) . We
performed the benchmarking for both the options on both the Amazon Webservices\cite{www-AWS} and Chameleon cloud\cite{www-Chameleon}.
The results are plotted and tabulated as below

Each of the benchmark runs was performed 100 times for a defined set of operations similar to the steps performed for setting up a elastic search cluster in docker and swarm.The results were gathered as a csv file  and plotted using a Ipython\cite{www-ipython}.

The hardware specifications used on both the clouds is listed below

Based on the benchmark reults we can infer the below details
\begin{enumerate}
\item  In the battle of the clouds Aws is around 20 percent faster than Chameleon cloud in docker mode
\item  Cloudmesh docker operations for the docker command performed in a local network are between
25 and 30  percent faster.We also noticed some network issues when performing the test from a
remote network however we chose to ignore those outliers in the plot.
\item The standard deviation of the response times is significantly lower for Aws than Chameleon indicating 
that Aws is much more stable and reliabe in performance than the chameleon cloud
\item The mean container create times range between 0.5 to 1 s which is significantly faster than normal VM 
boot times on the cloud .

\section{Conclusion}

In this project we have succefully integrated docker and swarm capabilities into
cloudmesh client.We have also demonstrated its use for a practical use case of
setting up a Elastic search cluster in docker and swarm modes.We have also 
benchmarked the commands for multiple clouds(AWS and Chameleon) in both 
local and remote modes and detailed the results and insights.The ansible scripts
as part of the project along with the capabilities built in the cloudmesh docker 
application provide for a seamless capability in deploying and provisioning applications
in docker and swarm containers.
