\begin{abstract}
A detailed analysis of the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE) data by
deploying Hadoop and Spark technologies on multiple clouds in a
distributed fashion\cite{nyse-git}. The analysis results are used to
observe stock trends. The results include highest change and lowest
change in stock prices for a given day and percent increase or
decrease in the stock prices which might be used by investors to make
smart decisions and observe the movement of a particular stock in the
market over a period of time\cite{ohlc-brighthub}.

\section{Introduction}
Newyork Stock Exchange(NYSE) is an American Stock Exchange. NYSE
records lots of data regarding trading and status of all the stock
information. OHLC(Open High Low Close) data is one of the popular form
of data in the stock market\cite{nyse-wiki}. Creating charts using the
OHLC data available from NYSE we intend to analyze stock trends and
correlations among the attributes like volume and price trends of
various stocks. The analysis being done as part of the project will
help us to look into the insights of the stock market and understand
the dynamic patterns of stocks and the trends of success and failure
of stocks\cite{stockmarketanalysis}.




\section{Milestones}

\begin{itemize}
\item Performing Analysis on local VM
\item Deploying Spark and Hadoop on FutureSystems or Chameleon Cloud
\item Analysis on the distributed cloud environment
\item Deploying Spark and Hadoop on one more cloud(Chameleon or FutureSystems)
\item Benchmarking
\item Final update with report
\end{itemize}


\section{Technologies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Distributed Computation and Storage:- Spark and  HDFS
\item Development:- Python and Java
\item Deployment:- Ansible
\end{itemize}

    
\section{Deployment}
Ansible Playbook is used as the application and configuration
deployment tool. Deploying the hadoop and spark framework into the
cluster environment. Ansible will help push configurations to the
environment automatically based on playbooks written for various
configurations


\section{Benchmarking}
TBD
