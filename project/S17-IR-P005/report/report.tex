\begin{abstract}
Wikipedia pages of famous personalities contain details like school, spouse,
coaches, languages, alma-meter etc. This information is in free form text. In
 this project, we extract the people information from the Wikipedia page and
 to establish relationships between them. Specifically, we use the data of
 known relationships to derive the newer relationships.

\section{Introduction}

Word2Vec \cite{www-word2vec} is a group of related models that are used to
produce word embedding. Word2Vec is used to analyze the linguistic context
of the words. In this project, we created Word2vec model using Wikipedia data
and news articles.  Our focus is people names occurring in the
Wikipedia data and to see if Word2vec can be used to understand relationship
 between people. Typically Wikipedia page for people and celebrities contain
  the entire family and friends, colleagues information. Our idea is to use
  Word2vec to see if using a smaller training set of known relationships
  whether we can derive similar relationship for anyone who has presence on
  Wikipedia. This mechanism can be then used to convert the data hidden in
  textual format to more structured data.

We used spark \cite{www-spark-python} to load the wiki data and create word
vectors. We then used vector manipulations to derive the relationships.

\section{Discussion}
The analysis of the results provided interesting insights.
Section \ref{appdiscussion} provides key insights on our experiments with
Word2Vec on Wikipedia data. Section \ref{deploymentdiscussion} provide key
insights on our experience of deployment and execution of Word2Vec
application on Chameleon and Jetstream cloud.

\section{Conclusion}

Using this project we conclude that we can use Word2Vev model on Wikipedia
and news data to find the relationships between the people.

We further conclude that Word2Vec based analytics can be performed on public
cloud systems like Chameleon cloud and Jetstream cloud. Our deployment
automation, which is implemented using Cloudmesh and Ansible technology
demonstrates the power of these technologies to achieve one touch deployment
and execution of applications across multiple clouds.
