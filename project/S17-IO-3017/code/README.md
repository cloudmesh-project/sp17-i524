### Setup VM

Following should be done for setting up VM on chameleon or jetsream cloud. It is assumed that user already has the cloud access. Default cloud should have been setup as chameleon or jetstream. While booting the VM, mention pearth as secgroup.

    cm secgroup add pearth http 8081 8081 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
    cm secgroup add ssh http 22 22 tcp 0.0.0.0/0
    cm secgroup upload
    cm vm boot --secgroup pearth
    cm vm ip assign
    cm vm ssh
