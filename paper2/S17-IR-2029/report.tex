\section{Introduction}
Mahout is an open source software to create scalable machine learning
models. The initial version of Mahout targeted to implement all ten
machine learning algorithms discussed in Andrew Ng's paper "Map-Reduce
for Machine Learning on Multicore"\cite{paper-NIPS2006_3150} with
scalability in mid. Further releases of Mahout added various
implementations of clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and genetic algorithms in Java for usage in single machine as well as
in clusters using map reduce.

As the popularity of in-memory softwares like Spark started gaining
popularity over disk based softwares like Hadoop, new features rolled
out by Mahout did not support MapReduce. "Samsara" is a module to do
algebraic operations which was released in Mahout version 0.10 and is
compatible only with frameworks like Spark\cite{www-Spark},
H2O\cite{www-H20} and Flink\cite{www-Flink} but not MapReduce based
frameworks. Samsara was mainly written in Scala and is optimized to
operate well independent of the background. Another key feature of
Samsara is that it supports R-like syntax for linear algebra
operations.

Mahout has many algorithms for MapReduce based frameworks like Hadoop.
Only some of them are implemented for in-memory based frameworks like
Spark. A full list of algorithms available in Mahout and the
frameworks supported by them is discussed in section 2.


\section{Features}
Mahout supports wide range of machine learning algorithms like
classification, collaborative filtering and clustering, dimensionality
reduction techniques like SVD, PCA and QR
decomposition\cite{www-mahoutFeatures}. Mahout Samsara environment
provides linear algebra and statistics operations. Each of these are
described in this section.

\subsection{Samsara - Math Environment}
Mahout Samsara\cite{www-samsara} is a math environment to create and
perform various math and linear algebra operations. Some of the key
functionalities are BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram),
distributed row matrix, distributed ALS (Alternating Least Squares),
PCA (principal component analysis), incore and distributed SPCA
(Stochastic PCA), SVD (singular value decomposition), incore and
distributed SSVD (Stochastic SVD), Eigen decomposition, Cholesky
decomposition and similarity analysis.

One of the main advantage of Samsara is it supports R and Matlab like
syntax using Scala's DSL (domain specific language) feature. DSL's are
syntactic sugars for easy interpretation. An example is provided in
section 5. Mahout Samsara is supported on Spark, H2O and Flink
engines. Samsara is not available in Hadoop and MapReduce based
engines but has a different implementation that supports all these math
operations.

\subsection{Classification}
Mahout has logistic regression using stochastic gradient descent,
naive Bayes, complementary naive Bayes, random forest and hidden
markov algorithms for classification. Naive Bayes available in Spark
and MapReduce is the only distributed classification algorithm. Others
are supported only on single machines.

\subsection{Clustering}
Mahout supports clustering algorithms like K-means, fuzzy k-means,
streaming k-means, spectral clustering and canopy clustering. These
are available only for single machines and MapReduce based
environments.

\subsection{Collaborative Filtering}
Mahout has implementation for user based and item based collaborative
filtering algorithms for single machine, MapReduce and spark
engines. It also has implementation of matrix factorization with ALS,
weighted matrix factorization using SVD for single machine and
MapReduce.

\subsection{Other}
Mahout supports several other features like Latent Dirichlet
Allocation, row similarity job, collocations, sparse TF-IDF (Term
frequency - inverse document frequency, a common feature used in
information retrival and document search) vectors from text, XML
Parsing, Email Archive Parsing for MapReduce engines. It also has
Evolutionary Processes/Genetic algorithms implementation that runs on
single machine.

\section{Licensing}
Apache Mahout is an open source software available for free commercial
usage and is licensed under Apache License, Version
2.0\cite{www-mahoutLicense}. Associated frameworks like Spark,
  Hadoop, Flink and H2O are also open source products.




\section{Ecosystem}
Mahout can be used with wide variety of distributed systems like
Spark, H2O, Flink and Hadoop. It can also be used on single machine. A
key benefit of Mahout is that the machine learning or math code can be
used and written in same syntax independent of backends.

An illustration of how Mahout works by using Scala DSL for math
operations with various engines is illustrated in figure 1.

\section{Use Cases}

An use case for recommendation system and a simple linear algebra
operation is provided in this section.

\subsection{Recommendation system with Spark Engine}
A recommendation system is used to recommend most relevant product
that he/she might be interested and boost the sales in online
platforms. Recommendation can be done based on user similarity or item
similarity. In case of user similarity, recommendation is provided
based on idea that users with similar interest would buy similar
products. Similar users are identified, grouped and recommendations
are made based on difference in set of products. Where as item
similarity is based on identifying the products that were bought
together and recommending the products that is not in customer's
basket or purchase history. Recommendation based on item similarity is
very popular in industry as number of product types is way less than
number of customers with regular purchase patterns in large retail
industry.

An illustration of how Mahout can be used with Spark for item based
recommendation is illustrated in figure 2.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/recommender-architecture}}
\caption{Recommender Illustration. \newline Source: \cite{www-recommendations}}
\label{fig:false-color}
\end{figure}

Mahout's MapReduce version of item similarity takes a text file that is
expected to have user and item IDs and provide recommendations based
on content.

\subsection{SPCA}
The equation to compute stochastic principal component analysis is
given in equation 1

\begin{equation}
G=B{B}' - C - {C}' + s_{q} {s_{q}}' {\xi}' \xi\
\label{equation1}
\end{equation}

where G is the matrix representation of the result of SPCA, B is the
input or feature matrix, C is correlation matrix of the inputs with B'
and C' as their transpose matrix, $s_q$ is standard deviation of each
feature and $\xi$ is covariance matrix and $s_q$', $\xi$' are their
respective transpose matrices.  

One line Mahout code to compute this using Scala DSL is illustrated
here,

{val g = bt.t \%*\% bt - c - c.t + $(s_q cross s_q) 
               * (xi \ dot \  xi)$ }



This could be used in single or distributed machine in Spark, H2O or
Flink to perform SPCA.

\section{Useful Resources}
Apache Mahout Cookbook\cite{book-mahout} by Piero Giacomelli is a good
introductory book on Mahout. Apache Mahout\: Beyond
MapReduce\cite{book-samsara} by Dmitriy Lyubimov provides an
exhaustive coverage of Mahout Samsara and math operations.

Mahout website\cite{www-mahoutResources} has a compilation of
useful resources like books, tutorials and talks about Mahout and
machine learning.

\section{Conclusion}
Apache Mahout provides an open source environment with scalable
algorithms for machine learning and math operations using DSL. It can
be used with multiple backends like Spark, Scala, Flink and
Hadoop. Same code can be used for single machine and distributed
computing of algorithms in any supported backends.
