\begin{abstract}
Graylog is an open source log management tool that allows an
organization to collect, organize and analyze large amounts of data
from its network activity. It enhances the basic log management
functionality by providing network traffic analysis, lucene syntax
based search, drill-down analysis of data using field statistics and
generates trigger actions based alert notifications. It integrates
with other open source technologies to address a larger distributed
system.

\section{Introduction}
Graylog allows management of an organization's computing resources in
a consistent way. It allows us to centrally collect and manage log
messages of an organization’s complete infrastructure. A user can
perform search on terrabytes of log data to discover number of failed
logins,find application errors across all servers or monitor the
acivity of a suspicious user id. Graylog works on top of ElasticSearch
and MongoDB to facilitate this high availability searching. It
provides a lucene like query language, a processing pipeline for data
transformation, alerting abilities and much more. Graylog enables
organizations, at a fraction of the cost, to improve IT operations
efficiency, security, and reduce the cost of IT \cite{www-graylog-crunchbase}.


\section{Architecture}

Graylog is written in Java and uses a few key open source technologies
like Elasticsearch and MongoDB. Additionally, for a larger setup
Apache Kafka or Rabbit MQ could be integrated to implement queueing.
A basic Graylog cluster consists of the following components:
\newline
\newline
Graylog server - It is the actual log processor system also
responsible for implementing security. The Graylog server nodes shall
be operated on the fastest CPU's available.
\newline
\newline
Graylog web UI - It is the Graylog web user interface where one can
view histograms, dashboards and create alerts.
\newline
\newline
MongoDB - MongoDB stores Graylog configuration information and the non
queried log messages. It prime purpose in the architecture is Metadata
Management \cite{www-graylogprocessing-severalnines}.
\newline
\newline
ElasticSearch - ElasticSearch is useful for storing actual log data
and perform search operations on them. Elasticsearch nodes should have
as much RAM as possible and the fastest disks linked to them. Messages
are only stored on Elasticsearch nodes. If we have data loss on
Elasticsearch, all messages are gone – except if the administrator has
created backups of the indices.

\section{Graylog Use Cases}

\subsection{Computer And Network Security}

The best way for intrusion detection is to monitor activity of all the
devices in the network.  Graylog allows a user to keep track of all
failed logins, rejected network connections or exceptions in the flow
of the application. It also allows a user to integrate other Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS) to correlate detected activity with logs from
all across the infrastructure \cite{www-graylog-org}.

\subsection{Centralized IT management}

Logging into every system and parsing the plain text log files to find
meaningful data is an arduous task for any IT engineer. Graylog allows
us to centrally collect all syslog and eventlog messages of the
complete infrastructure thus allowing to solve production issues in
real time. It does so by allowing the administrator to setup alerts
for any trigger actions like performance degradation or exceptions.

\subsection{Development and DevOps}

Graylog allows on demand monitoring of distributed applications by
giving tiered access to any developer in the organization to view
system and application logs. It works on top of elastic search nodes
to facilitate search operation on terrabytes of log data in a metter
of milliseconds. In case of a customer operation resulting in an
error, a developer shall need to search the logs with the customer id
and locate the relevant logs to find the root cause of the problem.

\section{Graylog Modules}


\subsection{Sending in log data}

Graylog needs a log source to serve its purpose. The message input
section is launched from the System -> Inputs section from the web
interface (or the REST API) and can be configured without the need to
restart any part of the system \cite{www-graylog-sending_data}.

Graylog is able to accept and parse RFC 5424 and RFC 3164 compliant
syslog messages and the Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)
\cite{www-graylog-sending_data}. For any devices on the network that
do not publish RFC compliant syslog messages we need to make use of
the plaintext messages.  The Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) is a
log format that avoids the shortcomings of classic plain syslog by
providing optional compression, fixed structure and a limits to
payload length to 1024 bytes. Syslog is prefered for direct logging by
machines in the network while GELF is suitable for logging from within
the applications.

\subsection{Search}

As Graylog uses ElasticSearch to facilitate searching, the search
syntax followed is very close to the Lucene syntax which is the
underlying implementation of Elastic Search. By default, search is
performed over all fields unless a specific field is specified in the
search query. Search features like fuzzy, wildcard, range searches
provided by Elastic Search API can be used to gain deeper insight to
data.  Graylog also provides a time frame selector which defines the
time range over which the search shall be performed. The time selector
could be relative, absolute or keyword based.<could extend this>
Graylog also allows a user to save his searches to view it later. A
user needs to save his search by a unique name and could load it later
from the system under the saved search selector.
 
Graylog automatically constructs a histogram for the search
results. The histogram depicts the concise number of messages received
grouped by a certain time period that is adjustable.  Based on a
user’s recent search queries,graylog also allows you to distinguish
data that are not searched upon very often and thus can be archived on
cost effective storage drives.

\subsection{Log Streams}

Graylog allows a user to create a set of rules to route messages into
user defined categories. A user could create a stream called 'Database
errors' and create a rule to direct all messages with the source
attribute as 'database' to that stream. Thus, the stream 'Database
errors' shall catch every error message from the system's database
hosts. A message shall be routed into every stream that has the
corresponding matching rule for the message. A message thus, can be
part of many streams and not just one \cite{www-graylog-streams}.

\subsection{Alerts}

Graylog alerts are periodical searches that can trigger some
notifications when a defined condition is satisfied
\cite{www-graylog-alerts}. To get notified when more than 50
exceptions occur in the range of a minute, an alert can be created
with the desired conditions.  While defining alerts, a user can also
specify the method of notification once the alert condition is
met. Notifications can be obtained by an email or by an HTTP request
to an endpoint in the system.

\subsection{Dashboards}

Graylog provides visualization through creation of dashboards that
allows a user to build pre-defined views on his data to assemble all
of his important data only a single click away
\cite{www-graylog-dashboards}. Any search result or metric shall be
added as a widget on the dashboard to observe trends in one single
location.  A user can also add search result metrics like result
count, statistical values, field value charts and stack charts to the
dashboard. These dashboards can also be shared with other users in the
organization.

\subsection{Full control and access through a REST API}

Both configuration settings and log data are available through the
Graylog REST API.  The Graylog web interface uses Graylog Rest API
internally to interact with the Graylog cluster. Graylog REST API
could be used for automation or integrating Graylog into another
system, such as monitoring or ticket systems
\cite{www-graylog-restapi}. Thus a network administrator can easily
integrate Graylog into his evolving architecture and build reports and
analysis.

\subsection{Filtering messages}

Graylog can use Drools to evaluate all incoming messages against a
user defined rules file. To discard any message before its written to
elastic search or to forward it to another system one can use Drools
rules to perform custom filtering \cite{www-graylog-blacklisting}.

\section{Comparision with Splunk}
Splunk is remarked as one of the best log management tools available
and is Graylog's biggest competitor.

\end{table}


\section{Conclusion}
Graylog provides an effective set of features to be adapted by any
small to medium size organization. Alert notifications, sharing of
dashboards and message filtering provide most features that any
network administrator desires from a log management system. Being an
open source tool it is cost effective compared to other log
systems. However, it needs an environment to be setup before it can be
operational. It has a steep learning curve with the responsibility of
managing the MongoDB and ElasticSearch instances being completely
managed by the user.  Hence, the choice to choose Graylog as an
organization's log management tool directly relies on the resources
in terms of either time or money that it chooses to employ.
